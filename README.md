# Vue 3 Learning Journey
This is my personal learning project to master **Vue.js 3** from the ground up.  
I'm practicing by building small components and features based on AI-generated exercises, starting with reactivity and Composition API, and gradually moving into more advanced topics like routing, state management, component communication, and more.

## About This Project

- **Purpose**: To learn and understand Vue.js 3 through hands-on practice.
- **Structure**: Each exercise is built as a separate component, organized in folders by topic.
- **Technologies Used**:
  - Vue.js 3
  - Vite

## Why This Project?
I'm following a learn-by-doing approach:
I ask for challenges → I solve them → I review my solution with help (like you!) to find better ways.

This repo is where I put everything together
